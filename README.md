# Python Developer Paph

The idea behind this repo is to have a place with all the best learning resourses organized by subjects.

Starting from very basic knowledge this paph leads to data science in finances and algotrading. But it also covers other subjects. It contain of veriety of resourses so you can choose among them and find the one that fits best to you and match your needs. 

Python is a general-purpose programming language. We'll start from creating simple programs being able to automate some boring everyday tasks. 

Creating games with PyGame add some fun and visualisation to our programming.

GUI libraries such as Tkinter and PyQt5 may help to develop different types of applications from games to desktop apps. 

Kivy is an open source Python framework for creating cross-platform multi-touch mobile applications with Natural User Interface.

Web scrapping can be very useful skill. And Python is getting popular in Automated Testing field.

Building bots for social media like Facebook or Instagram or popular among programmers Slack chat is one more essential skill.

Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications.  Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.

Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing. These libraries are covered in paph as part of Data Science Specialization. You'll get familiar with Anaconda and Jupiter Notebook.

Data Visualization and Data Analysis are highly developing fields activly using Python language.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
