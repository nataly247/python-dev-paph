# Python Developer Paph

The idea behind this repo is to have a place to log the learning process in an organized way.

Starting from very basic knowledge this paph leads to data science in finances and algotrading. But it also covers other subjects. 

Python is a general-purpose programming language. We'll start from creating simple programs being able to automate some boring everyday tasks. 

Creating games with PyGame add fun and visualisation to our programming. GUI libraries such as Tkinter and PyQt5 may help to develop different types from games to desktop applications. Kivy is an open source Python framework for creating cross-platform multi-touch mobile applications with Natural User Interface.

Web scrapping can be very useful skill. Python is getting popular in Automated Testing field.

Building bots for social media like Facebook or Instagram or popular among programmers Slack chat.

Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications.  Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.

Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing. These libraries are covered in paph as part of Data Science Specialization. You'll get familiar with Anaconda and Jupiter Notebook.
